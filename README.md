# 🌾 AgriLease
Unlocking Idle Land. Empowering Farmers. Strengthening Food Security.

AgriLease is a smart agricultural land-leasing platform that connects landowners with landless farmers using a secure PIN-based location matching system. Beyond leasing, the platform provides integrated financial access, agri-input e-commerce, real-time weather intelligence, and live market prices — creating a complete digital ecosystem for rural farmers.

Real-time weather & price intelligence

Affordable agricultural inputs

Language and digital literacy barriers slow rural tech adoption.

Result:

Reduced productivity
